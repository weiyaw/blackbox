Title: A SMC-SA Algorithm for Constrained Optimisation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kenyon Ng
Maintainer: Kenyon Ng <kenyon.ng@gmail.com>
Description: This packages implements three algorithms (SA, SMC-SA, CEPSO) to solve contrained optimisation problems. The algorithms work with any type of constraints and only need an indicator function that tells whether or not a solution is feasible. More information on Ng, 2019.
