# A SMC-SA algorithm for constrained optimisation.

This repository contains codes that implement the algorithms described in
"[A flexible sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for parametric constrained regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01072)".

You can painlessly install this package using `devtools`, which can be
downloaded and installed with the following one-liner:
```
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then, the installation of this package is just
```
devtools::install_github("weiyaw/blackbox")
```


More details to come. Please shoot me an email if you intend to explore this package, and I will write a guide on this as soon as possible.
