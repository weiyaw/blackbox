# A SMC-SA algorithm for constrained optimisation.

This repository containts the code that implements the algorithm described in "A flexible sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for parametric constrained regression".

More details to come. Please shoot me an email if you intend to explore this package, and I will write a guide on this as soon as possible.
